During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an evident decrease in outdoor activities, with grocery runs being one of them. In efforts to maintain low levels of physical contact, many resorted to online delivery services. However, there was an issue where some grocery stores didn't have items in stock or they did not hold that specific item in store. This led buyers with the options of having to purchase from multiple grocery stores online, miss out on some items or having to go in store. 

To resolve this conflict, GroFairy was created as an online web application that held multiple (mock) grocery stores with items stored in a databse, allowing users to add multiple items from multiple grocery stores and purchase their items all in one place.
